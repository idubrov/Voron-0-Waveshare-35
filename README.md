# What is this?

A mount for the [Waveshare 3.5" IPS Capacitive Touch LCD Display, 480x800](https://www.waveshare.com/3.5inch-480x800-lcd.htm) for the Voron V0.2 printer.

The screen uses HDMI connection for the video and USB-C connection for the touch signals.

Since I wanted to hide the connectors, and on this screen they stick to the side, I went with specialized cables used in FPV drones (I suppose?). They are smaller than the standard HDMI / USB-C cables. See BOM for the details and the photo.

The mount goes in between the front two skirts, similar to the stock mount. Note that the side skirts need to be trimmed as I haven't redesigned them yet.

I use this screen with the [BigTreetech Pi V1.2 board](https://biqu.equipment/products/bigtreetech-btt-pi-v1-2). I am not familiar with the Raspberry Pi ecosystem, but it should work with other boards that have HDMI connectors (BTT Pi V1.2 uses Micro HDMI, don't know about other Pi boards).
